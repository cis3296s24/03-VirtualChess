<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

Users have the options to select customizable settings such as a turn timer of adjustable length, the option to undo moves, and option to select their favourite theme for the chess board. Users can also turn on hints for an ideal move while playing the game. After finishing the game, users can also see their results from the leaderboard. For users, who are new to chess have the option to learn chess from this application. Our application provides a good user experiece, and is ideal for players from all skill levels.
