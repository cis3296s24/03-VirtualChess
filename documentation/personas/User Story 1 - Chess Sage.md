Edward, A 70-year-old retired school teacher
___
Edward Thompson, age 70, retired after a lifelong career as a dedicated schoolteacher. Born and raised in a close-knit
community, Edward's passion for education and love for learning defined his teaching philosophy. He used to play chess
as a kid but lost the time to play as he focused on his school work and then his job. Now, in retirement, he rediscovers
his childhood love for chess, eager to engage his mind in a new challenge and relive the joy it once brought him.

Edward has used computers throughout his years but is not as confident as he would like and may need some help
navigating the environment. He thinks that the tutorials in a chess app would be very helpful in learning these two
areas. A clean interface that is easy to navigate will also help this. Another feature that Edward sees in the chess
app that would be helpful to him is the ability to change the difficulty of the AI opponent he is facing. This would
allow him to learn at his own pace.
