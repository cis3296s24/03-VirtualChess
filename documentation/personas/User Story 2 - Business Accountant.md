# Persona Jeremy Frangrance, a business accountant 

Jeremy Fragrance is a 35-year-old accountant for a large accountant firm. He was born in Oldenburg, Germany to his father who worked as a machine mechanic in a toothpaste factory, and his mother who owned a small bakery. After graduating from high school, he received a full-ride scholarship to Harvard for business and graduated in 2011. He found a career at a large accounting firm in 2015 and has been one of the top performers in his field since then. His type of clientele requires him to air-travel a lot for in-person help and important meetings. He and his business partner Daniel Schütz are both big chess fans and were both in the Harvard Chess Club when they were in university. 

They both love chess and love to play whenever they are relaxing after a long day of work, but because they travel often, they don’t like to take a chess board with them. Most of the boards they have bought have either been ruined or crushed during the baggage flights. They also don’t want to buy an expensive one out of fear that it may get lost.  

Jeremy wants to use the Chess Application to: 

1.   Never worry about having to spend money on ruined or lost chessboards 

2.   Use a chessboard in any location with his business partner
