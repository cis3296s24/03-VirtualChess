Occupation: Social Media Influencer
___
Josh is a travel influencer hailing from Long Island, New York. Josh found meteoric success on Tik Tok, under his account “LandOfSweatshirts” and now travels the world, showing his followers the most authentic views into various locations, including exotic places such as France, Italy, Iceland, and Norway; but also showcasing many locations in America as well, including, New York City, Boston, Brownsville, and even Philadelphia. Josh loves having fun and finding new places, but he also enjoys the skill-based strategy of chess. Unfortunately, Josh is only an amateur at chess, but nevertheless he continues to play chess with many different people, including his mentor Michael Crinn, and even his old friend Danny Carson. Josh also enjoys playing chess with the followers of his page that he happens to run into on his various journeys. 

Josh wants a simple, clean-looking chess application that he can play with various people he encounters. Due to his need for ease of use, Josh would naturally prefer capability to play online with his friends and fans instead of having to share his personal device with others to play as this can be clunky and a potential risk of damage to his device due to his ultra mobile lifestyle. Josh is a bit of a joker and will certainly want the ability to take back moves in case he makes a blunder and will likely want the ability to alter the timer for turns so that he has enough time to document his most interesting games on his social media platform. Lastly, Josh will want an AI opponent with variable difficulty so that he can practice his chess skills on the train or plane during his travels.
