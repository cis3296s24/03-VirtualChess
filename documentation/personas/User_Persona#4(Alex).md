Alex, a high school student  
  
Alex, age 16, is a high school student, currently studying in his 10th grade. Alex is from Philadelphia, and he finished his elementary and middle school at his local neighborhood schools. He mostly plays action-adventure games such as war and combat games. However, he saw some of his friends play chess, and found it very interesting. So, he wants to learn and play chess too.  

He does not have a physical chessboard, and does not have anyone who can teach him the rules and techniques of chess. So, he thinks a virtual chess app is a great way to learn and play chess. He will be benefitted from the tutorials feature, where he can start learning about chess and chess pieces from scratch. Once he is comfortable, he can also practice by using the feature, Player vs Computer with different difficulty levels. He believes it will also help him become competitive when playing with his friends.
